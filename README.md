# Character Generator

A quick character generator that will let you create a Fighter, Mage, Thief or Cleric. You will be given random stats based on your choice and the option to re-roll if you would like.

## Using it

In order to use the character generator you will need to clone down the repo `$ git clone https://github.com/hcodydibble/character-gen.git` then `$ cd character-gen` then you will just need to type `$ python character_gen.py`

I hope you have some fun making random characters!
